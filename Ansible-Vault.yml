Ansible-Vault Using:

Creating New Encrypted Files
ansible-vault create vault.yml [here creating vault file for vault.yml playbook]
You will be prompted to enter and confirm a password:
Output
New Vault password: 
Confirm New Vault password:

Once done verify once vault file information has been encrypted or not?
Edit yml file with some information and execute cat vault.yml you will see the encrypted information.

Encrypting Existing Files
If you already have a file that you wish to encrypt with Vault, use the ansible-vault encrypt command instead.
For testing, we can create an example file by typing:
•	echo 'unencrypted stuff' > encrypt_me.txt
Now, you can encrypt the existing file by typing:
•	ansible-vault encrypt encrypt_me.txt

Viewing Encrypted Files

ansible-vault view vault.yml


Editing Encrypted Files

ansible-vault edit vault.yml

Manually Decrypting Encrypted Files

ansible-vault decrypt vault.yml

Changing the Password of Encrypted Files

ansible-vault rekey encrypt_me.txt

Encrypting specific variables
Best practice while using Ansible Vault is to encrypt only the sensitive data.
Ansible Vault allows you to encrypt only specific variables. You can use the ansible-vault encrypt_string command for this.
$ ansible-vault encrypt_string

You can also achieve the same thing in a single line. 
$ ansible-vault encrypt_string 'string' --name 'variable_name'
Ex: ansible-vault encrypt_string ‘all my passwords’ –name ‘password’
